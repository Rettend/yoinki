# Yoinki - Language Learning Chrome Extension
Welcome to Yoinki, a language learning Chrome extension that helps you improve your vocabulary and grammar skills through customized definitions and example sentences powered by ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art chatbot based on the GPT language model.

With Yoinki, you can:

- Choose from a variety of languages to learn, including English, Spanish, French, and many more.
- Customize the difficulty level of the definitions and examples to match your skill level.

Yoinki integrates with Anki, a popular flashcard app, to help you review and retain the new words and phrases you learn. Simply connect your Anki account to Yoinki and start creating flashcards with the definitions and examples generated by ChatGPT. You will also need to log in to chatGPT with a Microsoft account.

To get started with Yoinki, simply download the extension from the Chrome Web Store and connect your Anki account. You'll be able to choose your language and start practicing right away. With Yoinki, learning a new language has never been easier!
